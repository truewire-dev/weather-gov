/**
 * Type-check every TypeScript example in this package's README.
 *
 * `truewire docs check` does this for Python by running pyright over the blocks of
 * `README.md`; there is no TypeScript equivalent yet, so this is it: each ```ts block is
 * written out as its own module and `tsc` compiles the lot against the real package.
 * Nothing runs and nothing is sent, so an example that calls a method the client does not
 * have is a compile error rather than a bug a reader finds for us.
 *
 * Each block therefore has to stand on its own, imports included -- which is how a reader
 * uses one anyway.
