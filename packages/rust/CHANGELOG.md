# Changelog

## 0.3.0 (unreleased)

- **Breaking: six types moved to `weather_gov::types`.** `ObservationCollection` and
  `StationCollection` are each returned by more than one endpoint now, so they are shared
  schemas. Import them, and the types they carry, from `weather_gov::types`:
  - `stations::get_observations::ObservationCollection`
  - `stations::get_observations::ObservationCollectionType`
  - `stations::get_observations::ObservationPagination`
  - `stations::list_stations::StationCollection`
  - `stations::list_stations::StationCollectionType`
  - `stations::list_stations::CollectionPagination`

  The old paths fail to compile (`E0432`, or `E0603` for the two the modules still import
  privately).
- **Breaking: `types::Station` gains `distance` and `bearing`.** Both are
  `Option<QuantitativeValue>` and only `stations.list_stations_for_gridpoint` sends them.
  A `Station { .. }` literal must now name both, or end in `..Default::default()`.
- **Eight more endpoints: zones, and the stations of a zone or grid cell.** A new `zones`
  group (`list_zones`, `list_zones_by_type`, `get_zone`, `get_forecast` and
  `list_transmitters`), and `stations.list_stations_for_zone`,
  `stations.list_stations_for_gridpoint` and `stations.get_observations_for_zone`. Their
  requests take a zone type as one shared enum, `types::ZoneKind`.
